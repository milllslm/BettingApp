# Jackal

We have pivoted our idea! We are now a want-to-rent platform! Almost every Vandy/college student is familiar with the feeling of not having the right outfit for a ridiculously-themed party. Rather than shooting in the dark at a thrift store, why not ask the greater Vanderbilt community if someone has just what you need? That's where we come in.

The techical challenges for the projects are as follows: 

- Maintaining a clean interface for users.
- Allowing connectivity between users. 
- Providing a chat functionality for potential renter-rentee pairs.
- Maintaining and displaying renting/renter history to users.
- Communicating efficently between the clientside and serverside.
- Creating intelligent datatable structures for our database.
- Handling the many callback events that must happen with our database
- Providing a method for payment (Venmo API)?

The non-technical challenges:

- Concisely explaining to users what our platform does.
- Getting trial users to use our platform.
