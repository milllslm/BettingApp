# BettingApp

We are building a web platform for peer to peer betting using virtual coins. 
- The inspiration for this project came from our passion for trying to predict the future. 

The techical challenges for the projects are as follows: 

- Maintaining a clean interface for users.
- Allowing connectivity between users. 
- Maintaining the balances of all accounts and handling transactions when bets have been finalized.
- Maintaining and displaying betting history to users.
- Communicating efficently between the clientside and serverside.
- Creating intelligent datatable structures for our database.
- Handling the many callback events that must happen with our database

The non-technical challenges:

- Concisely explaining to users what our platform does.
- Getting trial users to use our platform.
- Finding a way to incentivize verifiers.
- Keeping users entertained without using real money.
